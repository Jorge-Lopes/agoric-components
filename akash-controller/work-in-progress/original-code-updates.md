1. Code directory was not created using the `agoric init` command
    Created an agoric project and moved the code to the new project

2. When running the unit test the following error was triggered:
    ```
    > yarn test

    yarn run v1.22.5
    $ ava --verbose

    Uncaught exception in test/test-contract.js

    ```

    The solution was to update how the `test` function was being imported
    Replacing 
    ```js
    import { test } from '@agoric/zoe/tools/prepare-test-env-ava.js';
    ```
    with
    ```js
    import '@agoric/zoe/tools/prepare-test-env.js';
    import test from 'ava';
    ```

3. When running the unit test the following error was triggered:
    ```
    zoe - watch Akash deployment, maxCheck=1, current Fund is sufficient

    Rejected promise returned by test. Reason:

    message: 'Cannot find dependency @agoric/babel-standalone for file:///Users/jorgelopes/Documents/GitHub/Agoric/ibc/agoric-akash-demo/node_modules/@agoric/install-ses/',

    Solution
    Replace '@agoric/eventual-send' with '@endo/eventual-send' on the package.json, contract and test

5. When running the unit test, when the contract fundAkashAccount function is executed, the execution of `await E(transferSeatP).getCurrentAllocation()` will trigger the following error:
    ```
    TypeError: target has no method "getCurrentAllocation", has ["getAllocationNotifierJig","getCurrentAllocationJig","getFinalAllocation","getOfferResult","getPayout","getPayouts","getProposal","hasExited","numWantsSatisfied","tryExit"]

    Solution
    Replace getCurrentAllocationJig with getCurrentAllocationJig

6. When running the unit test the following error was triggered:
    ```

    ```

    Solution
    Update the condition on the depositDeployment method of the makeFakeAkashClient function 
    from:
    ```js
    t.is(
        amount,
        `${akash.deployment.value}uakt`,
        'Deposit amount did not match',
      );
    ```

    to:
    ```js
    t.is(
        amount.amount,
        `${akash.deployment.value}`,
        'Deposit amount did not match',
    );
    ```

7. When running the unit test the following error was triggered:
    ```

        The fund should be deducted

        Difference:

        - 4980000n
        + 5000000n
