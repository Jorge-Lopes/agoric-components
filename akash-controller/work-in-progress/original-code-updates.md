# Changes made to the original code

## Contract and test files

1. Code directory was not created using the `agoric init` command
    Created an agoric project and moved the code to the new project

2. When running the unit test the following error was triggered:
    ```
    > yarn test

    yarn run v1.22.5
    $ ava --verbose

    Uncaught exception in test/test-contract.js

    AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION] [ERR_ASSERTION]: The expression evaluated to a falsy value:

        assert(refs.runnerChain)

        at async Promise.all (index 0)

    SES_UNHANDLED_REJECTION: (AssertionError#1)
    AssertionError#1: The expression evaluated to a falsy value:

    assert(refs.runnerChain)


    assert(refs.runnerChain)

    ```

    The solution was to update how the `test` function was being imported
    Replacing 
    ```js
    import { test } from '@agoric/zoe/tools/prepare-test-env-ava.js';
    ```
    with
    ```js
    import '@agoric/zoe/tools/prepare-test-env.js';
    import test from 'ava';
    ```

3. When running the unit test the following error was triggered:
    ```
    zoe - watch Akash deployment, maxCheck=1, current Fund is sufficient

    Rejected promise returned by test. Reason:

    Error {
    message: 'Cannot find dependency @agoric/babel-standalone for file:///Users/jorgelopes/Documents/GitHub/Agoric/ibc/agoric-akash-demo/node_modules/@agoric/install-ses/',

    Solution (require more research)
    - Copy the yarn.lock file from the original repository

4. When running the unit test the following error was triggered:
    ```
    yarn test
    yarn run v1.22.5

    Uncaught exception in test/test-contract.js

    ```

    Solution
    Replace '@agoric/eventual-send' with '@endo/eventual-send' on the package.json, contract and test

5. When running the unit test, when the contract fundAkashAccount function is executed, the execution of `await E(transferSeatP).getCurrentAllocation()` will trigger the following error:
    ```
    TypeError: target has no method "getCurrentAllocation", has ["getAllocationNotifierJig","getCurrentAllocationJig","getFinalAllocation","getOfferResult","getPayout","getPayouts","getProposal","hasExited","numWantsSatisfied","tryExit"]
    ```

    Solution
    Replace getCurrentAllocationJig with getCurrentAllocationJig

6. When running the unit test the following error was triggered:
    ```
      zoe - watch Akash deployment, maxCheck=1, IBC transfer succeeded

    Deposit amount did not match

    Difference:

    - {
    -   amount: '20000',
    -   denom: 'uakt',
    - }
    + '20000uakt'

    ```

    Solution
    Update the condition on the depositDeployment method of the makeFakeAkashClient function 
    from:
    ```js
    t.is(
        amount,
        `${akash.deployment.value}uakt`,
        'Deposit amount did not match',
      );
    ```

    to:
    ```js
    t.is(
        amount.amount,
        `${akash.deployment.value}`,
        'Deposit amount did not match',
    );
    ```

7. When running the unit test the following error was triggered:
    ```
      zoe - watch Akash deployment, maxCheck=1, current Fund is sufficient

        The fund should be deducted

        Difference:

        - 4980000n
        + 5000000n

    Solution
    Replace the value of the last assertion from 5000000n to 4980000n
    Replace the t(1) with t(4)

## Local-ibc

1. The first issue I noticed was related with the faucet link, `http://55ma08d6b9aht4gtovcih95dps.ingress.edgenet-1.ewr1.aksh.pw/faucet`, which is no longer active. That made me realize that the Akash network used, `edgenet-1`, is also discontinued.

    So the updates made to the makefile and hermes.config was based on this repository:
    https://github.com/akash-network/net/tree/master

    - Changes made to makefile:
    ```
    CHAIN_AKASH=testnet-02

    task/tap-akash-faucet: hermes.config
        @echo tapping faucet
        @echo per https://faucet.testnet-02.aksh.pw
        curl -X POST -d 'address=$(ADDR_AKASH)' https://faucet.testnet-02.aksh.pw
        mkdir -p task && touch $@
    ```

    - changes made to hermes.config
    Note that the IP address for `testnet-02.aksh.pw` is `216.153.52.237` 
    ```
    [[chains]]                                                               
    id = 'testnet-02'
    rpc_addr = 'http://216.153.52.237:443/'
    grpc_addr = 'http://216.153.52.237:9090/'
    websocket_addr = 'ws://216.153.52.237:443//websocket'
    ```

2. When calling make start, the following error is triggered:

    ```
    mkdir -p task && touch task/restore-keys
    tapping faucet
    per https://faucet.testnet-02.aksh.pw
    curl -X POST -d 'address=akash1h68l7uqw255w4m2v82rqwsl6p2qmkrg028euar' https://faucet.testnet-02.aksh.pw
